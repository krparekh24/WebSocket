Steps to create this solution:

Server Component:
1.	Create a .NET application in C# using either .NET Framework or .NET Core. You can choose a project type that you are comfortable with, such as a console app, Web API, or a graphical application.
2.	Decide on your data source:
•	If you want to use external data, consider making HTTP requests to the sample REST API provided in the task description (http://dev-sample-api.tsl-timing.com/) to retrieve real-time data.
•	If you prefer to generate your own data, you can simulate data changes at regular intervals within the server component.
3.	Implement a server that uses raw TCP/UDP sockets or WebSockets to establish connections with clients.
4.	As the data changes, send updates to connected clients in real-time. For WebSockets, you can use a library like SignalR for easy real-time communication.
Client Component:
1.	Create a client application. You have the flexibility to choose the type of client application you are comfortable with:
•	If you choose WinForms or WPF, create a desktop application that displays real-time data updates.
•	If you prefer web development, you can create a web app using vanilla JS or a front-end framework like React or Vue.js.
2.	Connect to the server using the appropriate protocol (TCP/UDP or WebSocket) and receive real-time data updates.
3.	Display the data updates to the user in an appealing and understandable format. Be creative in how you present the data.
Source Control:
•	Initialize a Git repository for your project.
•	Make regular commits and push them to your repository as you make progress. This allows the reviewers to see your development process.
